# Segmented Control

## Segmented Control Taxonomy:
Actions / Segmented control / Segments / Size / icon

| Segments | Size | Icon |
| : | : | : |
| 2 segments | 01 large | 01 text |
| 3 segments | 02 small | 02 icon+text |

## Usage
Segmented control is a group of actions that are thematically-related and mutually exclusive (i.e. cannot select more than 1 at a time). They can be used to make a selection, OR used as a content-switcher, i.e. an either/or option with a default selection always applied. There's usually a limit to how many segments the component can support.

## Recipes
